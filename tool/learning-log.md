### 10/4/2025:
* Started watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56mG7DezGs) for about 10 minutes.

    * Built onto Javascript
    * Javascript gives a lot more flexibility.
    * Type Script helps with checking your Javascript code
    * Helps write code faster
Some challenges was trying to install the tool as it was acting up and still not working so next time will include some code.

For the next learning log I'm gonna be writing the actual code and testing out the tool as I have not figured out how to install the tool yet.
