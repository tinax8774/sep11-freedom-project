### 10/4/2025:
* Started watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56mG7DezGs) for about 10 minutes.

    * Built onto Javascript
    * Javascript gives a lot more flexibility.
    * Type Script helps with checking your Javascript code
    * Helps write code faster
Some challenges was trying to install the tool as it was acting up and still not working so next time will include some code.

For the next learning log I'm gonna be writing the actual code and testing out the tool as I have not figured out how to install the tool yet.

### 11/2/2025:
* Continued watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56mG7DezGs)

* Started looking at the code and learning it's function a bit

``` js
if ("" == 0) {
  // It is! But why??
}
if (1 < x < 5) {
  // True for *any* value of x!
}
```

* Similar to what were doing in conditionals as `==` means something is the same and when put into the if statement it is basically saying that the x value is greater than 1 but less than 5.

``` js
let a = (4
')' expected.
```
* It helps detect errors in code as in this case was a missing parenthesis.

Some challenges were still trying to figure out how to use this tool and understanding its function.

Next time I'm gonna try and see to what extent can it fix mistakes to.
