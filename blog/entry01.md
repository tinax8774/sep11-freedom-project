# Entry 1: Choosing a Tool
##### 11/3/2025


Content:
For my freedom project this year I chose the tool of TypeScript. I chose TypeScript because when writing code there is sometimes where there is an error in the code which helps with debugging many lines of code. I tinkered with this tool by using the code on the website and playing around with it and seeing if it actually detects all errors in lines of code. Below is some code:


``` js
let a = (4
')' expected.
```
In this example there was a missing parenthesis which was detected and said what was needed to fix it.


``` js
const obj = { width: 8, height: 10 };
const area = obj.width * obj.heigth;
Property 'heigth' does not exist on type '{ width: number; height: number; }'. Did you mean 'height'?
```
In this one the thing that was wrong was the word height which clearly mentioned what it was supposed to say.


### EDP(Engineering Design Process)
We are currently on the first step which is determining what we are doing as we chose our topics and now our tool. The next step is continuing to learn our tool.


### Sources
The sources I used was the [website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-from-scratch.html) and also a youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56mG7DezGs).


### Skills
One skill is how to learn because just like last year we still have to learn our tool on our own, basically doing self learning. Kinda fun just learning on our own, mostly going based on our own skills and youtube videos.


Another skill is time management as I had to balance many classes so homework piled up but I still found time in my day to learn my tool no matter how little time or patience I had.
